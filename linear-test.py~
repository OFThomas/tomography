# Title: Comparison between different state distances
#
# Date created: 19th June 2018
#
# Language:    Python 3
#
# Overview:    The point of this program is to compare the 
#
# Details:     The script performs the following steps:
#
#              1) Generate random one qubit density
#                 matrices as follows: pick x in [0,1];
#                 pick a random unitary U; and compute
#
#
#                          -       -
#                         | x     0 |
#                 p = U * |         | * U^
#                         | 0   1-x |
#                          -       -
#
#                 x should be picked in such a way
#                 that the resulting distribution for
#                 p should be suitably uniform (caveat!)
#                 Alternatively, it should be possible
#                 for the user to put in a specific
#                 density matrix.
#
#              2) Fix a set of measurement operators,
#                 and generate sample data from the
#                 distribution of outcomes implied by
#                 the state p.
#
#              3) Choose an estimator for p, and
#                 compute the estimated state p~
#                 using the data generated in step
#                 2. Then compare p~ with p.
#
#              4) Compare the generated density matrix
#                 with the original density matrix
#                 using some measure of distance (e.g.
#                 Hilbert-Schmidt norm, operator norm,
#                 etc.)
#
# Notes:       1) Throughout, the Hermitian conjugate
#                 of a matrix A is is denoted A^
