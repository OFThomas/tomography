* Linear estimator tests
** 17th July 2018 -- Tests without random unitaries
Tested both the cpp and python programs in the case of a diagonal density matrix (i.e. no random unitary generation). The output of estimation errors measured using various distances are similar, meaning the norms are probably right. The results are in linear_test_no_random_unitary_[cpp/python]_1.dat. When the random unitaries are included the output distribution is different -- so something is up with the generation of random unitaries.
