* Linear estimator tests
** 17th July 2018 -- Tests without random unitaries
Tested both the cpp and python programs in the case of a diagonal density matrix (i.e. no random unitary generation). The output of estimation errors measured using various distances are similar, meaning the norms are probably right. The results are in linear_test_no_random_unitary*. When the random unitaries are included the output distribution is different -- so something is up with the generation of random unitaries. However, implementing both random unitaries in exactly the same way (from the paper '2009 Ozols - How to generate a random unitary matrix') the output distributions look very similar -- those results are in linear_test_with_randomies*. Compared to the case without random unitaries, only the fidelity looks substantially different (flat in the case of no random unitaries, and U shaped when random unitaries are included).
