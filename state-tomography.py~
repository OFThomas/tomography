# Title: Quantum state tomography simulation
#
# Language: Python
#
# Description: Simulation of linear quantum state
#              tomography on randomly generated
#              1 qubit states. Linear quantum
#              state tomography involves estimating
#              the density matrix of the 1 qubit
#              state by measuring successive
#              instances of the state in an
#              informationally complete basis of
#              operators, and then using the relative
#              frequencies of the results to determine
#              the coefficients of the density matrix
#              expressed in this basis of operators:
#
#              E.g. (p = density matrix)
#
#              p = tr(pI)I + tr(pX)X + tr(pY)Y + tr(pZ)Z
#
#              Since tr(pS) is the expectation value
#              of S in the state p, repeated measurement
#              of S followed by averaging will result in
#              tr(pS).
